# Direct-Marketing-Model-To-Identify-Potential-Investors

Business marketing data can be mined to provide useful information. This project focuses on direct marketing data that combines personal information from investors in order to anticipate potential financial investors for the Company.
I've used a linear regression model to do it here. Utilize exploratory data analysis and statistical analysis to check the consistency and correlation of the data during the process setup. In addition, I used a normality check, a multi collinearity check, and a constant variants check to ensure that the data was correct. The experiment results include the best precision of 93 percent as a result of using log transformation and square root transformation to minimise errors.
